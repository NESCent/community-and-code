<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

The Phylotastic project aims to enable convenient, computable, credible access to expert knowledge about the Tree of Life through a network of open-source webservices.  When complete, Phylotastic will allow any scientist, educator or student to input a list of species and obtain a phylogeny in ready-to-use form on the fly. Phylotastic is the primary product of the NESCent’s Hackathons, Interoperability, Phylogenies (HIP) working group. It was conceived by the HIP leadership team in January 2012, and was initiated by several dozen participants at a NESCent hackathon on June 4-8, 2012. 

The second phylotastic hackathon took place at iPlant’s headquarters in Tucson, Arizona on January 28 through February 1, 2013. This second hackathon built upon the architecture that the first created, and moved the project closer to a fully-functional alpha version. When complete, the Phylotastic alpha will include working prototypes of the central Phylotastic operations, which include storage and retrieval of expert species phylogenies, taxonomic name resolution, tree pruning and output of the requested phylogeny.  In keeping with the general hackathon concept, we also provided opportunities for the 26 participants to propose and work on new directions related to the project’s core goals.
