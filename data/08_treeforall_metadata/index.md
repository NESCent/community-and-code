<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

The NSF-supported Open Tree of Life project has (1) gathered, encoded and annotated >4000 published phylogenies (“source trees”), (2) combined several taxonomic hierarchies into a reference taxonomy, and (3) used this information to generate a synthetic tree covering >2.5 million species. OpenTree provides access to all of this information via raw downloads, and also via queryable online interfaces that can be invoked by external software. However, tools that actually use these interfaces to deliver phylogenetic knowledge into the hands of scientists have not been developed yet.

To facilitate the development of tools that use its resources, Open Tree of Life, Arbor and the NESCent HIP working group jointly held a hackathon for testing, expanding and building upon the Open Tree of Life APIs. The Tree-for-all event was held September 15 to 19, 2014 at the University of Michigan. Details of the event and outcomes are on the hackathon GitHub repository.
