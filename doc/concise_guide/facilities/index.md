## Facilities, equipment and supplies

### Plenary room layout and furnishings

All hackathon activities can be staged in a single room of sufficient size (>1200 square 
feet) and sufficient sound-deadening properties so that up to 8 teams can work separately 
in the room. The room must have a projection screen, chairs for everyone, and enough 
tables (sized for up to 8 people) for all the teams. A sufficient number of power strips – 
at least one outlet per participant – must be available, with all cables safely secured 
(e.g. taped to the floor). Notify international participants of the types of outlets and 
voltages used.

### Breakout space

Optionally, breakout space may be provided separate from the plenary room. To facilitate 
inter-group interactions as well as hackathon-wide communication, breakout spaces should 
all be very close (e.g., same building and floor).

### Audiovisual equipment

The plenary room needs a projector and any required video adapters. Hacking spaces need 
power outlets, power cords, and access to a wireless network with sufficient capacity. 
 
### Other equipment and supplies
 
Pitching requires a dozen marking pens and either flipchart easels or 2-foot-by-3-foot 
adhesive notes to be stuck to walls (note that cloth-covered walls, brick walls, and 
certain kinds of paneling will not support adhesive notes). 

### Avatar laptops

Participants bring their own laptops. Avatar laptops may be used as part of a strategy to 
support remote participants (see Supporting Remote Participation).
