## Managing a NESCent hackathon

### Preconditions

A funded budget, a hackathon plan with a scope, and a roster of participants. 

### Roles involved

Facilitators, Trainers, Support staff. 

### Outputs

Execution of hackathon plan, including travel and event logistics, resulting in tangible 
outputs.  

### Process

#### Travel arrangements 

Travel arrangements begin at least 5 weeks before the event. Participants are sent 
instructions to arrange travel and lodging as soon as possible, following any guidelines 
to ensure reimbursement. 

#### Pre-event engagement 

In the 2 weeks before the event, organizers create opportunities for participants to 
communicate in a common forum (email list, issue tracker, teleconference). The purpose is 
to exchange knowledge and ideas, build community, identify training needs, and introduce 
supportive technologies. 

#### Planning for Day 1 training

The organizers recruit individuals to provide instruction on topics they identify. The 
focus is on filling gaps in knowledge to ensure success of the hackathon, including 
scientific and technical knowledge, and the use of supportive technologies chosen for the 
event. 

#### Day 1 Facilitation

The activities of day 1 must be orchestrated carefully. In a room full of 30 people who do 
not know each other well, activities that appear simple (e.g., introductions) can go wrong 
in ways that waste valuable time and drain energy. The success of Day 1 depends both on 
the months of preparation that brought together a group of people to work on a topic, and 
on effective facilitation. 

- **Opening** - Welcome participants, thank sponsors, reiterate the scope and aims, 
  describe the schedule, and introduce facilitators. Allow 10 minutes.
- **Introductions** - Ask participants to give name, affiliation, and a sentence about the 
  special skills or knowledge they are bringing to the event. Keep introductions short, 
  allowing no more than 10 minutes for 30 people. 
- **Presentations** - Introduce designated presenters, who provide instruction and respond 
  to questions. Allow from 1 to 3 hours.  
- **Facilitated open discussion** -  The purpose is to identify opportunities and 
  challenges, and discuss promising ideas. This discussion is the first stage in the 
  development of team projects. Discussion ends when the sense of the room is that there 
  are enough technically feasible, in-scope ideas to provide opportunities for everyone. 
  Facilitators begin by reiterating the scope of the hackathon, and then invite comments 
  that pose important challenges, or suggest projects. Facilitators steer the discussion 
  away from implementation details: once it has been determined that an idea is 
  technically feasible, no further discussion of implementation choices is needed. If 
  facilitators sense that key topics remain un-discussed, or that a block of people is 
  going to have trouble fitting in, they should prompt for broader participation to avoid 
  a subsequent failure in team coalescence. Many people are sensitive to criticism of 
  ideas, and are easily silenced or intimidated, even by responses that are not meant to 
  be personal or intimidating. Facilitators may wish to provide guidance on asking rather 
  than judging or criticizing, e.g. rather than responding to an idea with “this won’t 
  work because of X”, ask the question “how do we work around X?”; rather than saying 
  “nobody will use this” ask “what’s the intended user-base for this?”; rather than saying 
  “that isn’t in scope”, ask “how do you align that with the scope?”.  Allow 60 to 120 
  minutes.  
- **Break** - Participants intending to make a pitch need a few moments to collect their 
  thoughts. Allow 15 minutes. 
- **Pitching** -  This is the second stage in development of team projects. The goal is to 
  ensure each participant understands each idea. The facilitator invites champions to 
  present a pitch (concept, proposed approach, tangible outcomes) in less than 3 minutes. 
  Participants are instructed to ask only information questions to understand the pitch 
  and how it aligns with the scope: this is not a time for critique or discussion.  Yet, 
  some champions may abandon pitches at this stage. Allow 30 minutes.   
- **Team coalescence** - This is the third stage in development of team projects. It ends 
  when every participant is part of a team of 3 to 7 people. The facilitator provides 
  initial instructions, and then steps aside. Champions are asked to create a poster and 
  find a position in the room at least 8 feet from any other poster. Participants are 
  instructed that team coalescence is a multi-way negotiation to ensure a productive fit. 
  One person’s special skills may induce a change in the project to take advantage of 
  those skills. Champions are instructed to welcome potential team members, and to be open 
  to new directions. All participants are instructed to join the team that maximizes their 
  contribution to the hackathon (if they can find no way to contribute, they must choose 
  the project that maximizes their chances to learn). This means that champions may choose 
  to abandon a pitch to join another project. Facilitators may intervene to help novice 
  participants, and to interrupt technical discussions that interfere with being welcoming 
  to newcomers. Allow 30 to 75 minutes.  
- **Team plan, optional report-out and work sessions** - Facilitators instruct teams to 
  break out to separate areas where they will develop and commit to an initial project 
  plan that specifies tangible outcomes and approach. This is the last stage in forming a 
  hackathon team, and it may be done as a continuation of the previous stage.  Allow 20 
  minutes. If time allows, teams may begin work. Facilitators may choose to end the day by 
  re-convening everyone to hear brief team reports (allow 20 minutes). 

#### Days 2 and later

Except on the last day, participants convene in mid-afternoon to hear teams report on 
accomplishments and challenges. Facilitators limit discussion to practical topics of broad 
interest, encourage teams with common problems to work together, encourage stalled teams 
to change tactics, and remind participants to complete tangible outcomes and document 
their accomplishments before the hackathon ends, because they likely will not work on this 
when they return to their “day jobs”. 

#### Wrap-up

Participants convene to hear final team reports and discuss issues of broad interest, 
including opportunities and plans for follow-up.
