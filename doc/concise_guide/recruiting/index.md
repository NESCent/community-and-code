## Recruiting for a NESCent hackathon

### Preconditions

A team of organizers committed to executing the existing hackathon plan for outreach and 
recruitment. 

### Roles involved

Organizers

### Outputs

A roster of prospective participants committed to attending the event. 

### Process

- **Event publicity** - The organizers delegate one or more of their members to 
  disseminate announcements with information on the location, date and theme of the 
  hackathon. Text developed for this may be re-used in recruitment. Advertising the event 
  well in advance, before the call for applications, is helpful in getting it “on the 
  radar” of potential applicants.
- **Application form** - Guided by their recruitment plan, organizers make an online 
  application form. This requires a design-implement-evaluate-revise workflow that cannot 
  be done at a single meeting. For the NESCent model we recommend that the form request: 
    - **Statement of interest** - a brief narrative responsive to the hackathon’s scope, 
      indicating what the applicant hopes to achieve by participating. 
    - **Statement of qualification** - a brief narrative responsive to the hackathon’s 
      scope, describing relevant skills and knowledge, and making verifiable references to 
      accomplishments (e.g., a link to a code repo or a paper).
    - **Open-source commitment** - an acknowledgement that all hackathon products are 
      expected to be open source. 
    - **Full attendance commitment** - an acknowledgement that the applicant is available 
      and intends to attend the entire event from start to finish. 
    - **Diversity information** - gender and status as underrepresented minority. 
    - **Location** - the origin of travel to the event (for purposes of budgeting)
    - **Travel support** - support available from other sources for travel, meals, or 
      lodging (for purposes of budgeting).  
- **Open call** - The organizers draft an open call for participation using welcoming 
  language. The open call is disseminated in venues that reach the target community at 
  least 3 weeks before the application deadline, and is subsequently re-issued one or two 
  times.   
- **Direct recruitment and invited applications** - The organizers may recruit specific 
  individuals to participate, either by reserving them a seat, or by inviting them 
  personally to apply (we prefer the latter). This approach can be used both to ensure 
  that certain technologies or projects are represented at the hackathon, and as part of a
  strategy to improve diversity. 
- **Application review** - The organizing team assigns each member a set of applications 
  to review, such that each applicant receives 3 reviews. Organizers read an application, 
  assign an expected contribution score from 1 (participation is unlikely to augment 
  success of the event) to 3 (participation will surely augment success), and make a brief 
  comment explaining the score. This can be done in a spreadsheet (e.g., in a Google 
  spreadsheet linked to the online application form). Applicants are then ranked by their 
  average score. 
- **Finalizing a roster** - The organizing team reserves an extended block of time (1.5 to 
  2 hours) to decide on a roster based on the ranking of applicants, the budget, and any 
  other criteria they wish to apply. An obvious starting point is to order the applicants 
  by rank, and designate how much travel support may be offered to each one, working down 
  the list until the travel money runs out (this can be automated using a spreadsheet 
  calculation). The organizers may then adjust this initial roster to improve the 
  composition of the group with respect to skills, aims, or diversity. The organizers may 
  wish to identify additional applicants to be invited if someone declines an invitation. 
  Applicants to be invited are contacted and urged to respond within a week. Finalizing 
  the roster may take 2 weeks. The end result is a list of people definitely committed to 
  attend the event, with a plan to support their expenses.
