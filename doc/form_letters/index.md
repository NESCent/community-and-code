## Form letters

When recruiting participants of a hackathon through an open application procedure, fairly
large numbers of people need to be contacted to let them know whether their application 
was accepted and how the logistics planning should proceed from there on. For this latter
issue, we have distinguished between participants that require full financial support for
their travel and accommodation, people that require partial support, and people that are
fully self-funded. Hence, there is a couple of different letters that needs to be sent
more or less simultaneously. Here are two examples from two hackathons:

- [phylotastic](phylotastic_letters.txt)
- [treeforall](treeforall_letters.txt)
