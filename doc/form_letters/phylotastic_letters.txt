Subject: Phylotastic - confirm participation by 30 March

Dear <NAME>,

Thank you for your application to participate in Phylotastic [1], the first hackathon 
organized by the HIP (Hackathons, Interoperability, Phylogenies) Working Group [2] at 
NESCent. On behalf of the HIP leadership team, I am excited to inform you that your 
application has been accepted.

To reserve your seat at the Phylotastic hackathon, we must receive confirmation from you 
by March 30, 2012, of your commitment to participate.  

Your commitment includes participating in pre-event discussions (online and possibly via 
teleconference), attending the actual hackathon event, and responding to follow-up queries 
after the event. The hackathon will start at 9 am on June 4, and end at 3 pm on June 8. 
Please let us know in your response if you expect limitations to your ability to 
participate before or at the event (e.g., prolonged travel before the event, or having to 
arrive later or depart earlier than the stated start and end times).

<FULL-SUPPORT>
	Your application indicated that you need financial support. NESCent will support your 
	airfare, lodging, meals and incidental travel expenses. Once you have confirmed your 
	seat, you will receive instructions on how to arrange your travel, the Center’s Travel 
	Policies, and other logistics from Xxxx Xxxxx, NESCent’s logistics coordinator. 
</FULL-SUPPORT>
<PARTIAL-SUPPORT>
	Your application indicated that you are able to pay some of your own expenses, which 
	we appreciate.  Based on this, NESCent will pay for your airfare, but lodging, meals 
	and incidental travel expenses will be your own responsibility. Once you have 
	confirmed your participation, you will receive instructions on how to arrange your 
	flights, the Center’s Travel Policies, and other logistics from Xxxx Xxxxx, NESCent’s 
	logistics coordinator.
</PARTIAL-SUPPORT>
<NO-SUPPORT>
	Your application indicated that you are able to pay your own expenses. We greatly 
	appreciate this support. Once you have confirmed your participation, you will receive 
	information on arranging your trip from Xxxx Xxxxx, NESCent’s logistics coordinator. 
	Xxxx will be able to assist you with reserving a room at the same place as other 
	hackathon participants.
</NO-SUPPORT>

To give you an idea of what will be happening next, here is a brief outline of upcoming 
steps:
- We will put up a preliminary list of participants on the hackathon wiki [1].
- We will create a mailing list and subscribe all participants (such as you).
- We will schedule one or possibly several teleconferences to initiate participant-driven 
  planning.

Please feel free to make changes, comments, additions etc to the hackathon wiki. The wiki 
is publicly visible, but to edit and create pages you need to log in. You can create 
yourself an account through the OpenID login.

Once again, thanks for applying.  We're excited about your participation.  Over the coming 
weeks, we look forward to sharing with you the responsibility for developing a hackathon 
plan that fits our unique set of participants.  

On behalf of the organizers,

Rutger Vos
