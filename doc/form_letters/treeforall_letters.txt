Dear <applicant>,

Thank you for your application to the Tree-for-all hackathon, jointly sponsored by Open 
Tree of Life [1], Arbor Workflows [2] and the NESCent HIP (Hackathons, Interoperability, 
Phylogenies) working group [3]. On behalf of the organizing team, I am  happy to inform 
you that your application has been accepted.  

=Deadline for confirmation=
To reserve your seat at the hackathon, please respond to this email with confirmation of 
your attendance by Friday, July 25, 2014. We note that there will be several remote 
participants, so if you would prefer to participate remotely, let us know.

=Event details=
The hackathon will start at 9 am on Monday, September 15 and end at 3 pm on Friday, 
September 19, all times EDT (GMT-4). 

We will cover the costs of your flight, hotel,  all meals and shuttles to and from the 
Detroit Airport (DTW). We will not cover transportation to and from your home airport, or 
parking at your home airport. Once we receive your confirmation, we will send instructions 
on how to arrange travel. Please do not book your own flights at this time!

=Pre-hackathon planning=
In the lead up to the event, we will continue to discuss potential projects on the 
hackathon issue tracker [4]. We encourage everyone to participate - pitch a new idea, ask 
a question or add a comment. The more we know about potential project ideas, the better we 
can be prepared for how you want to use the OpenTree APIs.

We will also create a mailing list for all confirmed participants for general information 
and questions.

Once again, thank you for applying to Tree-for-all. We are excited about the project ideas 
that we have seen so far, and optimistic that this is going to be a fun and productive 
week.  

Cheers,

Karen Cranston

Rejection letter

Dear <applicant>,

Thank you for your application to the Tree-for-all hackathon, jointly sponsored by Open 
Tree of Life [1], Arbor Workflows [2] and the NESCent HIP (Hackathons, Interoperability, 
Phylogenies) working group [3].  There were many more qualified applicants than we had 
spaces, so we had to make some difficult decisions. I regret to inform you that we cannot 
offer you a space at the event. 

We hope this doesn’t lessen your enthusiasm for participating in future hackathons or 
open-source development, whether with Open Tree of Life or other projects. 

Sincerely,

Karen Cranston
