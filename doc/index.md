## Prose documents

This directory contains prose documents that illustrate and assist with the planning and
organizing of a NESCent hackathon. In particular, we here provide a concise guide for 
some of the main organizational steps and a number of sample documents we've used to
communicate with potential participants (announcements, application forms, standard 
letters).
