## Hackathon application templates

Under the NESCent hackathon model, a large number participants enrolls through open 
applications. We commonly managed this using google forms, which give users a friendly
interface to fill out and which aggregate responses in an online spreadsheet. The PDF
files here show what these forms looked like for some of the hackathons, while a generic 
application template can be copied from the following google doc: 

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c97_VH30EKxbWXpNZ_Tqb9gX_z-bWiTMIKq4p2PzkhQ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1c97_VH30EKxbWXpNZ_Tqb9gX_z-bWiTMIKq4p2PzkhQ)

To use this, go to the URL, then click "create a copy" to make your own version. The 
"Form" menu allows you to view or edit the form. Protect confidential applicant 
information by keeping the spreadsheet private, shared only with hackathon organizers. 

Here are some examples of application forms:

- [phylotastic2](phylotastic2_application.pdf)
- [rpopgen](popgenR_application.pdf)
- [treeforall](treeforall_application.pdf)

The _Comparative methods in R_ hackathon didn't use an online form but asked candidate
participants to respond in an email that addresses the points listed in 
[comp_methods_R_application.txt](comp_methods_R_application.txt).
