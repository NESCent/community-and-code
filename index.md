## Community and Code: Nine Lessons from Nine NESCent Hackathons

[![CC0 - 'No Rights Reserved'](https://i.creativecommons.org/p/zero/1.0/88x31.png)](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

The NESCent hackathon model is a style of hackathon developed and refined over a period of 
10 years, with primary sponsorship of the erstwhile National Evolutionary Synthesis Center 
([NESCent](http://nescent.org)), which was located in Durham, North Carolina, USA. 

This style of hackathon, which typically lasted 5 days and involved about 30 people, was 
designed to serve a relatively small and widely dispersed academic discipline 
(computational evolutionary biology) facing challenges of interoperability, backed by a 
sponsor (NESCent) dedicated to nurturing a community of practice committed to open science 
and open software development. 

At these hackathons, participants gathered on day 1 to discuss challenges and opportunities. 
By the end of the day, they had assembled into a small set of teams, each committed to a 
creative, collaborative project of its own design. On the remaining days, each team worked 
to produce tangible outcomes.

So that others might benefit from our experiences, we have attempted to condense these 
into a scholarly publication (entitled _Community and Code: Nine Lessons from Nine NESCent 
Hackathons_) and a data set, which is stored in this repository. We intend this to be of
use for prospective sponsors of hackathons, for organizers, and for scientists seeking to
study the hackathon phenomenon.

### For prospective sponsors

Hackathons come in many shapes and sizes. If your organization is thinking about 
sponsoring a hackathon, you may be considering what kind of hackathon to run, how much it 
will cost, how to organize it, and what kind of outcomes can be expected.  

We provide a detailed guide to the process of organizing and staging a NESCent hackathon, 
which takes several months. The budget is predominantly for travel and lodging for the 
participants (plus administrative support), which depends heavily on the extent to which 
participants are recruited locally. 

NESCent hackathons have intangible outcomes like building a shared awareness of challenges 
and opportunities within a community, and drawing attention to a sponsor's resources, as 
well as tangible outcomes such as source code, documentation, and installations. All teams 
produce tangible outcomes. 

The typical team project ends when the hackathon ends, but frequently individuals or teams 
continue to work after the event to produce downstream outcomes, including software 
improvements, presentations, proposals for funding, and manuscripts for publication.  

To find out if the NESCent model is right for you, consider, for example, the following: 

* What are you looking to get out of it? For example, if you are looking to promote a 
  particular technique or technology (such as a product of your organization) you might 
  want to scope your hackathon narrower than was common in our approach. In our manuscript 
  we do cite some examples of such hackathons that you might emulate, but we have always 
  sought to advance our field in somewhat broad terms and so have encouraged our 
  participants to take ownership of the exact scoping of our hackathons.
* What motivates your participants? Some hackathons that we've studied had competitions 
  and gave out prizes, but in our own model, participants were motivated by a mixture of
  wanting to learn, wanting to interact with people they normally might not meet, improve 
  the infrastructure in our research field, and become permanent contributors to a 
  _community of practice_.
* How long can you claim your participants? Our hackathons were relatively long (usually
  five days). This is longer than many other hackathons, which often have a nature more
  of a 'code sprint' in comparison.
* Do you value the development of a diverse community? A substantial amount of our effort 
  has gone into recruiting new contributors to our community, including people from 
  traditionally underrepresented groups. 
  
### For organizers and facilitators

As a hackathon organizer (or prospective organizer), you may want to know how to show 
potential sponsors that hackathons are valuable, and you may be considering how to 
organize an event that is successful in advancing the sponsor's aims. The NESCent 
hackathon manuscript explains the kinds of outcomes and impacts that can be expected from 
a NESCent hackathon.  We also provide a detailed guide to the process of organizing and 
staging a NESCent hackathon, a process that spans several months, at varying levels of
intensity during different stages of the process.

### For researchers on hackathon outcomes and impacts 

This repository stores material developed for a project that aims to:

* Document the NESCent model, providing concise guidance for prospective organizers.
* Provide evidence of impact (useful for organizers to sell hackathons to sponsors).
* Convey lessons learned from our experience.
* Lay a foundation for future research (including a data framework and our suggestions 
  about research methods and questions).

## Repository structure

The files in this repository are organized at the top level as described below (the sub-
folders also have descriptive documents in them with more information about the contents
of that directory):

- [doc](doc) - examples of organizational documents (announcements, form letters, sample 
  applications)
- [data](data) - tabular data on hackathon events, participants, projects and products
- [img](img) - supporting images for the prose documents in this repository
